The PNPT certification exam is a one-of-a-kind ethical hacking certification exam that assesses a studentâ€™s ability to perform an external and internal network penetration test at a professional level.  Students will have five (5) full days to complete the assessment and an additional two (2) days to write a professional report.

In order to receive the certification, a student must:
* Perform Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) to gather intel on how to properly attack the network
* Leverage their Active Directory exploitation skillsets to perform A/V and egress bypassing, lateral and vertical network movements, and ultimately compromise the exam Domain Controller
* Provide a detailed, professionally written report
* Perform a live 15-minute report debrief in front of our assessors, comprised of all senior penetration testers
