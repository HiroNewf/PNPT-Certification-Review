## Certification Overview                                                                                                                                       
The PNPT certification exam is a one-of-a-kind ethical hacking certification exam that assesses a studentâ€™s ability to perform an external and internal network penetration test at a professional level.  Students will have five (5) full days to complete the assessment and an additional two (2) days to write a professional report.

In order to receive the certification, a student must:
* Perform Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) to gather intel on how to properly attack the network
* Leverage their Active Directory exploitation skillsets to perform A/V and egress bypassing, lateral and vertical network movements, and ultimately compromise the exam Domain Controller
* Provide a detailed, professionally written report
* Perform a live 15-minute report debrief in front of our assessors, comprised of all senior penetration testers

## Preparations 
There are 5 courses created by TCM Security that cover all that you will need to know to take and pass the PNPT exam. These 5 courses are as follows; Practical Ethical Hacking, Linux Privilege Escalation, Windows Privilege Escalation, Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Fundamentals, & External Pentest Playbook. Combined this about 50 hours of course content and since most of it is hands on with labs that you build yourself, it will probably take you much more than the 50 horus to work through. It probably took me around 150 hours to go through it all myself, between watching the videos, following along, troubleshooting issues, & taking good notes. These courses are *incredible* and teach you a *ton* of valuable information without any fluff or wasted time. They are also all included with the price of the exam ($400) which is a pretty good deal compared to some of the other popular certification providers... *cough* Offsec *cough*. Nevertheless these courses will teach anything you need to know from basically 0 (some basic tech knowledge and networking knowledge is required, but no security/hacking knowledge is needed to start the courses). 

After completed the 5 given courses I completed many extra practice boxes/networks in my jurouny to PNPT including, but not limited to; Wreath, Holo, Throwback & Red Team Capstone all from Tryhackme and then Forest & Sauna from HackTheBox. So with all of these machines and networks under my belt which ones are the ultimate practice boxes for the PNPT? ... None of them. None of them were helpful during the exam, if anything they hurt me because I wasted time trying to do things that I learned within these practice machines that was outside of the scope of the PNPT courses and that lead to me wasting valuble time during the exam. If you have taken all 5 of the courses for PNPT, have good notes on them and truely understand the content within them, then you are ready for the exam. You do not need to memorize these courses, that is what good notes are for, but you do need to understand them. Once you reach that point just take the exam, don't waste more time and money on other practice platforms just go for it.
