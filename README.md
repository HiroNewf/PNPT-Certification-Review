## Certification Overview                                                                                                                                  	 
The PNPT certification exam is a one-of-a-kind ethical hacking certification exam that assesses a studentâ€™s ability to perform an external and internal network penetration test at a professional level.  Students will have five (5) full days to complete the assessment and an additional two (2) days to write a professional report.

In order to receive the certification, a student must:
* Perform Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) to gather intel on how to properly attack the network
* Leverage their Active Directory exploitation skillsets to perform A/V and egress bypassing, lateral and vertical network movements, and ultimately compromise the exam Domain Controller
* Provide a detailed, professionally written report
* Perform a live 15-minute report debrief in front of our assessors, comprised of all senior penetration testers

## Preparations
There are 5 courses created by TCM Security that cover all that you will need to know to take and pass the PNPT exam. These 5 courses are as follows; Practical Ethical Hacking, Linux Privilege Escalation, Windows Privilege Escalation, Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Fundamentals, & External Pentest Playbook. Combined this is about 50 hours of course content and since most of it is hands-on with labs that you build yourself, it will probably take you much more than the 50 hours to work through. It probably took me around 150 hours to go through it, between watching the videos, following along, troubleshooting issues, & taking good notes. These courses are *incredible* and teach you a *ton* of valuable information without any fluff or wasted time. They are also all included with the price of the exam ($400) which is a pretty good deal compared to some of the other popular certification providers... *cough* Offsec *cough*. Nevertheless these courses will teach you everything you need to know from basically 0 (some basic tech knowledge and networking knowledge is required, but no security/hacking knowledge is needed to start the courses).

After completing the 5 given courses I completed many extra practice boxes/networks in my journey to PNPT including, but not limited to; Wreath, Holo, Throwback & Red Team Capstone all from Tryhackme and then Forest & Sauna from HackTheBox. So with all of these machines and networks under my belt which ones are the ultimate practice boxes for the PNPT? ... None of them. None of them were helpful during the exam, if anything they hurt me because I wasted time trying to do things that I learned within these practice machines that were outside of the scope of the PNPT courses and that led to me wasting valuable time during the exam. If you have taken all 5 of the courses for PNPT, have good notes on them and truly understand the content within them, then you are ready for the exam. You do not need to memorize these courses, that is what good notes are for, but you do need to understand them. Once you reach that point just take the exam, don't waste more time and money on other practice platforms just go for it.

## The Exam
After completing the 5 courses and then wasting a bunch of time on practice boxes it was time for the exam. You get 5 days of access to the exam environment and in that time you have to compromise the domain (get domain admin) and establish persistence within said domain. 5 days is plenty of time to get it done so don't feel like you have to rush through it, take your time and take plenty of breaks. I have a couple pieces of advice for this; firstly make sure you take good notes, being able to know what you have tried, what worked, what didn't and what ideas you might have is crucial. Additionally you will need good notes and screenshots for your report so do not forget to do this. My second piece of advice is to not waste time doing anything that is not within the courses provided by TCM Security, I know you have probably heard it a million times by now but everything you need is within the courses! If you find yourself stuck and your notes are failing you go back and watch some of the course videos, don't go watching some random guy trying to hack something completely unrelated and waste your time, go back to Heath and I'm sure you can figure out what to do.

After the exam is over it is time for the report. TCM Security provides some examples and templates for this and I also have a basic template on my github if you want to check it out. Make sure to include everything you found within your report, it's better to give too much information then not enough. Everyone is better at different things but I found this to be the easiest part of the exam for me personally. There is still one more step left though... the debrief.

I am not the best at being sociable, but you gotta do what you gotta do. To get your PNPT you have to give a presentation to a member of TCM Security about your findings during the exam. You can just use your report for this presentation, but I personally made a quick slideshow on Google Slides and it worked out great for me. Just like your report make sure to be thorough in this presentation (but not too thorough as you only have 15 minutes to work with here).

## Conclusion
Right after the debrief I was informed that I had passed. I got emailed my certification and the PNPT role was added to my discord account within the TCM Security discord server (which you should totally join if you are not in there already). It was a huge relief to finally pass and I learned a ton from this whole experience. I only have two other certifications so far (Security+ and Network+), but this was by far the best experience I have had studying for and obtaining a certification. The whole process was amazing, the content incredible, & TCM Security's support team is fantastic to deal with, not to mention so fast to reply to your emails. I would recommend the PNPT to anyone who is either working as or hoping to become a Penetration Tester.
